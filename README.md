Solved tasks for qosf mentorship


I have implemented the solution to task 1 using a variation on the task 3 numpy simulator on Task1.ipynb.


For the notebook to work you should first install the libraries in requirements.txt



I have reproduced only the functions used in the solutions in Qiskit on Task1-Quiskit.ipynb, and checked they work as expected.
